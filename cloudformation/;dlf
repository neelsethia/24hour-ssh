[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       AWS  CloudFormation  allows you to create and manage AWS infrastructure
       deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use AWS  CloudFormation
       to  leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon
       Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service,  Elastic  Load
       Balancing,  and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable,
       cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the  under-
       lying AWS infrastructure.

       With  AWS  CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and depen-
       dencies in a template  file.  The  template  defines  a  collection  of
       resources  as  a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates
       and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages  all
       dependencies between the resources for you.

       Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other  AWS  products.  If  you  need
       additional  technical information about a specific AWS product, you can
       find the product's technical documentation at [4mdocs.aws.amazon.com[24m .
